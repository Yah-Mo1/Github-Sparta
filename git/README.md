### **What is Git?**

Git is a free, open-source version control system used to track changes in files and collaborate on projects. It allows multiple people to work on the same codebase, keep a history of changes, and revert to previous versions if needed. It's widely used in software development to manage source code efficiently.

### **Git Workflow Summary**

1. **Clone or Initialize a Repository**

   - Start by either cloning an existing repository (`git clone <url>`) or creating a new one (`git init`).

2. **Make Changes Locally**

   - Edit files in your project directory.

3. **Stage Changes**

   - Add modified or new files to the staging area with:  
     `git add <filename>`  
     (or use `git add .` to stage all changes).

4. **Commit Changes**

   - Save your staged changes with a descriptive message:  
     `git commit -m "Your commit message"`

5. **Push to Remote Repository**

   - Upload your commits to a remote server like GitHub:  
     `git push origin <branch-name>`

6. **Pull Changes from Remote**

   - Sync your local repository with the latest changes from the remote:  
     `git pull origin <branch-name>`

7. **Create and Merge Branches (Optional)**
   - Create branches to work on new features without affecting the main codebase:  
     `git branch <branch-name>`
   - Switch to a branch:  
     `git checkout <branch-name>`
   - Merge a branch back into the main branch:  
     `git merge <branch-name>`

### **Key Benefits of Git Workflow**

- Keeps track of every change with version history.
- Enables collaboration by managing conflicts and merging work.
- Supports branching, allowing parallel development and experimentation.

This process ensures your code is organized, collaborative, and safe from accidental loss!
